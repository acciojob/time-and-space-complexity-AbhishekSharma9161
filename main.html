  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. 
    An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient because it executes faster for large inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to execute completely. 
    It is often represented using notations like O(n), which indicates how the memory usage grows with input size.
